  1. [Mon, Mar 03, 09:39 AM] [MEMBER]: Hi Advik, I'd like to discuss my upcoming trip to Europe next week and how I can maintain my exercise routine while traveling. Can you provide some guidance on how to adapt my workout plan to accommodate the time change and varying schedules?
  2. [Mon, Mar 03, 09:51 AM] [ADVIK]: Hi Rohan, I'd be happy to help you adapt your workout plan to accommodate the time change and varying schedules during your trip to Europe. Based on your Garmin watch data, I've noticed that your RMSSD value has been trending downward over the past week, indicating that your body may be under stress and needs more recovery time. Considering your upcoming trip, I propose a protocol to adjust your exercise intensity and incorporate more recovery-focused workouts to help improve your HRV. To adapt to the time change, I recommend gradually adjusting your workout schedule by 1-2 hours every 2-3 days to minimize the impact of jet lag on your body. Additionally, I suggest incorporating more flexibility and mobility exercises that can be done in a hotel room, as discussed with Rachel earlier. I've attached a detailed document with a sample workout plan and recovery-focused exercises tailored to your needs. Let's review it together and create a personalized plan for your trip.
