  2. [Mon, Jul 28, 11:52 AM] [CARLA]: Hi Rohan, I've reviewed your current nutrition plan and goals. To optimize your diet for better cognitive function and focus, I recommend increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and complex carbohydrates. Consider adding foods like fatty fish, nuts, seeds, and whole grains to your meals. I've also included a list of suggested recipes and snacks that can help support your cognitive health. Let's work together to implement these changes and monitor their impact on your overall well-being.

I've taken a look at your recent travel schedule and health goals. To help you manage stress during travel, I recommend incorporating relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga into your daily routine, especially during flights or downtime. Additionally, consider packing healthy snacks, staying hydrated, and getting enough sleep to help mitigate the effects of travel stress.

 11. [Thu, Jul 31, 12:47 PM] [RACHEL]: Rohan, great to connect. I've reviewed your goals and current exercise plan. To optimize your morning routine and occasional runs for better cardiovascular health, I recommend incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength exercises to improve your overall heart health and resilience. Given your family history of heart disease, it's excellent that you're taking proactive steps. I've designed a 4-week Cardiovascular Health program for you, focusing on functional movements that will support your joints and enhance your running efficiency. This program will include 3 sessions per week, with a mix of cardio and strength training. Let's work together to build a strong foundation for your cardiovascular health.
